My first embarkment in the world of html. This is a simple recipe book website created entirely with html, with zero elements of css or javascript. I wanted to test my ability to utilize every aspect/element I have learned thus far, including: headers, paragraphs, images, bold/italics, links, unordered lists and ordered lists, etc.

I tried to inject some personality (obviously the recipes are not great) to show that not only can I code, but I am capable of creating something the client can find engaging. Even if it is just a fairly bare bones html site.

Thank you for taking the time to read, and for checking out my work!
